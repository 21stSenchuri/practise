Once upon a time, in the quiet village of Eldenwood, there lived a young girl named Elara. Eldenwood was known for its ancient, towering trees and the gentle river that flowed through the heart of the village. The villagers lived simple lives, their days filled with farming, weaving, and storytelling by the fireside.
